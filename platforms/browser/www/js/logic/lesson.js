Buying new clothes may bring pleasant emotions and change image for the better. But a lot of people consider shopping to be a waste of time and money. Men usually do not like to go shopping very much. And women cannot resist the temptation of buying a new becoming dress.",
	        ex2: "Buying food is not so interesting for me. I usually do not have much time for that. That's why I often go to the nearest supermarket, where I may buy everything I need. Along with fish, milk, fruit and vegetables that I usually buy, I also choose something sweet, like biscuits or a cake. That makes shopping in a supermarket more pleasant.",
	        ex3: "When I come home after classes I start preparing my dinner. It usually consists of vegetable soup for the first course, stewed fish with vegetables for the second one and stewed fruits or jelly for dessert. I do not have supper, as I do not want to overeat before going to bed. But sometimes I eat an apple or drink a glass of apple juice. I think, the food I choose is healthy and helps me to keep fit."
